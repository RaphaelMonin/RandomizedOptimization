# RandomizedOptimization

The code and the data are both available here:

https://github.com/RaphaelMonin/RandomizedOptimization

The file: diabetes.csv contains the data I worked on for the second part of the assignment.

The file: RandomizedOptimization.ipynb contains the code and the output for both parts of the assignment.

To run the code, you just need to download or clone these two files. Download jupyter notebook, and run every cell (you also need to uncommend the first cell to download pandas, sklearn and matplolib if you don't have them).
